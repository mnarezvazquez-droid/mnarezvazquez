"""Unit Tests for the Shared Spreadsheet Header Vocabulary

The framework and the Telar Compositor both decide what a Spanish column
header means, from two independent tables. Three divergences have been
found this way: the `medium` family, the manual-step `audience` values,
and the accented aliases — each one because one side asked the other.
That works and it does not scale, and it stops working the moment neither
side happens to ask.

`tests/fixtures/column-headers.json` is the instrument that replaces
asking. Both sides keep a copy and maintain the union, so a spelling
either side accepts is a spelling both are tested against.

The accent property is the one that found the last divergence. Half the
Compositor's accented forms were present and half were not, and there was
no rule distinguishing them — the signature of a list maintained by hand,
one spelling at a time. A derived property cannot drift that way.

Gender is meaning rather than spelling: `privado` and `privada` are
different words about different things, and a rule that folded them
together would be wrong in the direction that matters. So the derivation
strips diacritics and never touches a final vowel.
