"""
An object id is the key two sheets are matched on, so it means what was typed.

pandas reads `objects.csv` and a story's CSV separately and infers each
column's dtype from that column alone, so a site using numeric object ids
could have `1` become the float 1.0 in one sheet and the integer 1 in the
other, on the strength of a blank cell in one of them. The two sides then
spell the same key differently and a step loses the object it names — the
image simply does not appear, with the story otherwise intact.

An id is not a quantity: `007` and `7` are different objects, and an author
who types a leading zero means it. These tests pin both sides of the match to
the author's text, and pin the reference check that reports a step naming
something the site does not have — the check is what keeps a mismatch from
being silent.
