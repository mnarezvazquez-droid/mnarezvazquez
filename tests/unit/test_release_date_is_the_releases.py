"""Unit Tests for `telar.release_date` Meaning One Thing

A site's `_config.yml` carries `telar.release_date` beside `telar.version`,
and the two upgrade routes filled it from different sources. The engine
stamped the day the upgrade ran; the Compositor stamps the day the release
was published. So two sites on the same framework version disagreed, and
the key answered neither question reliably.

Settled with the Compositor: the key means **the release's date**, and the
framework moves. It is the value their route has always written, it is the
one the key's name claims, and reading it from the release rather than the
clock makes an upgrade reproducible — the same site upgraded twice now
produces the same file.

Each migration therefore declares the date of the release it installs,
beside the version it installs, taken from that release's git tag. A
separate table would be a second place to keep the same fact.
