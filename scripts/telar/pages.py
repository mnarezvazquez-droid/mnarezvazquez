User pages for the Jekyll pages collection.

widget, image, markdown and glossary pipeline, choosing a localized sister
file where the site's language has one. Also checks each page's `title_key`.

# Front-matter keys a page source does not get to decide. A page's URL comes
# from the `pages` collection permalink and its layout from the collection
# default, so a source claiming either takes a decision that belongs to the
# build. Pre-0.9.0 sites carry both — `layout: page` and `permalink: /about/`

# the page generated from it at the same address, which Jekyll reports as a
# conflict and the build gate then fails on.
