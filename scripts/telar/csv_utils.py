CSV Utility Functions

This module deals with the low-level operations that prepare raw CSV data
before the processors for projects, objects, and stories take over. It sits
at the very start of the build pipeline: every CSV file passes through
these functions before reaching the code that understands what an "object"
or a "step" actually means.

The central piece is `COLUMN_NAME_MAPPING`, a dictionary that maps Spanish
column headers to their English equivalents. Telar added bilingual CSV
support in v0.6.0, so a spreadsheet can use either "paso" or "step",
"objeto" or "object", and so on. The mapping also handles backward
compatibility — for example, the old column name "layer1_file" is mapped
to the current "layer1_content". `normalize_column_names()` applies this
mapping to a DataFrame's columns, printing an info line for each rename
so the build log shows what happened.

`read_sheet()` is how every site sheet is read. It reads every row to the
header's width, so a row ending in a trailing comma is neither dropped nor
turned into a row index that moves every value one column left, and it
prints a warning naming the sheet and row for any value past the header's
last column, which is not published.

`is_header_row()` detects duplicate header rows that sometimes appear in
bilingual CSVs (where the first data row repeats the column names in the
other language). It checks whether 80% or more of a row's non-empty cells
match known column names, and if so, the row is skipped during processing.

`sanitize_dataframe()` strips the Christmas tree emoji from all string
columns. This prevents user-entered data from accidentally triggering
Christmas Tree Mode, which is a development/testing feature that injects
fake error objects into the build.

`get_source_url()` resolves an object's image source with backward
compatibility: it checks the `source_url` column first (v0.5.0+ standard),
then falls back to the legacy `iiif_manifest` column (v0.4.x), returning
an empty string if neither is present.

The mapping dictionary has grown with each release. It now covers clip
control columns for video and audio steps (`inicio_clip` → `clip_start`,
`fin_clip` → `clip_end`, `bucle` → `loop`), an accessibility column
(`texto_alt` → `alt_text`), short-form layer button and content names
(`boton1` → `layer1_button`, `contenido1` → `layer1_content`), and the
rename of the gallery classification column from `object_type` to `medium`
— with backward-compatible aliases (`tipo_objeto`, `medium_genre`,
`medio_genero`) so existing spreadsheets continue to work without changes.

    Two spellings of one header collide on the same terms. Every lookup
    downstream folds case and trims, so `Note` beside `note` is one column
    written twice and pandas holds both under one label again. Grouping the
    sheet's own columns rather than the rename map is what sees it: a caller
    that folded its headers before calling leaves two identical labels, and
    a map keyed by label collapses those into a single entry.
