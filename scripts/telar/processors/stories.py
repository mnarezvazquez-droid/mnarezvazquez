"""
Story Processor

This module deals with converting a story CSV into the JSON that drives
a Telar narrative. Each row in the spreadsheet represents one "step" in
the story — a combination of a viewer object (the image the reader sees),
a question-and-answer pair, and up to two content layers (panels that
slide in from the side with text, images, or interactive widgets).

`process_story()` is the main entry point. It receives a pandas DataFrame
from one story CSV and performs several passes over the data:

1. **Object validation** — checks that every object ID referenced in the
   `object` column actually exists in `_data/objects.json`. Lookups are
   case-insensitive, so `MyMap` matches `mymap`. Missing references
   produce localised viewer warnings that appear in the story's intro
   panel.

2. **Content processing** — for each content column (`layer1_content`,
   `layer2_content`, and their legacy `_file` equivalents), the function
   determines whether the cell value is a markdown file reference (ending
   in `.md`) or inline text typed directly into the spreadsheet. File
   references are loaded by `read_markdown_file()` from the markdown
   module; inline text is processed by `process_inline_content()`. Both
   paths run through the same pipeline: widgets first, then images, then
   markdown-to-HTML conversion, during which glossary links (`[[term_id]]`
   syntax) are resolved by `process_glossary_links()`.

3. **Answers** -- the step's `answer` is rendered to the HTML the story
   publishes, by `render_answer()`: it renders as panels do, is made prose
   (widgets, media, tables, code blocks, rules and footnotes come out;
   headings, quotes and lists become paragraphs), gets glossary links, and
   is held to the budget in `telar.answer_budget`, the length that fits the
   side card without scrolling. An answer over it is cut, and `answer_long`
   says whether the answer is set in the smaller type. The `question` is a
   heading and is left as written.

4. **Coordinates** — empty `x`, `y`, and `zoom` cells get default
   values (0.5, 0.5, 1) so the viewer always has a valid starting
   position. A comma decimal (`0,5`) is read as the number it is. Any
   other cell that is not a number is reported and left as typed.

5. **Warning aggregation** — all warnings (missing objects, missing
   markdown files, broken glossary links, widget errors, answers held to
   the limits, coordinates that are not numbers) are collected
   into a `viewer_warnings` list stored in `df.attrs`, which the core
   module later injects into the JSON output for display in the story's
   intro panel.

In Christmas Tree Mode, `process_story()` appends additional fake
warnings covering every warning type (viewer, panel, glossary) so that
the intro panel's error display can be visually tested.
