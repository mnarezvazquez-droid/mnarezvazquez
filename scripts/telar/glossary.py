Glossary Loading and Linking

This module deals with Telar's glossary system, which lets authors link
terms in story panel text to glossary definitions. Glossary terms can be
defined in two ways:

1. **CSV file** (v0.8.0+): `telar-content/spreadsheets/glossary.csv` (or
   `glosario.csv` for Spanish-language spreadsheets) with columns `term_id`,
   `title`, `definition`, and `related_terms`. This is the preferred method
   for spreadsheet-first workflows.

2. **Markdown files** (legacy): Individual `.md` files in
   `telar-content/texts/glossary/`, each with YAML frontmatter containing
   `term_id` and `title`.

If both exist, CSV takes precedence and a warning is shown.

`load_glossary_terms()` checks for CSV first, then falls back to markdown.
It builds a dictionary mapping each `term_id` to its display title. This
dictionary is then passed to `process_glossary_links()`, which runs on
already-converted HTML text (after markdown processing) and replaces
`[[term_id]]` or `[[display text|term_id]]` syntax with clickable links.

If a term ID exists in the glossary, the link is rendered as an `<a>` tag
with `class="glossary-inline-link"`, a `data-term-id` attribute holding the
stored key, and a `data-term-url` attribute holding the path the term's page
is published at. `telar.js` fetches that path when the link is clicked.
Demo glossary terms (those prefixed with `demo-`) get an extra
`data-demo="true"` attribute.

The page path is not the stored key. Jekyll publishes each glossary page at
`/glossary/:name/`, where `:name` is its slugified filename, lowercased: the
page for `IIIF` is at `/glossary/iiif/`. `glossary_term_slug()` reproduces
that rule, and the path is joined to the site's configured baseurl here
because story text reaches the browser through `story.html`'s `jsonify`,
which does not resolve Liquid inside it.

If a term ID is not found in the glossary, the link is rendered as a
visible error indicator with a warning emoji, and a warning is appended
to the `warnings_list` so it appears in the build output and in the
story's intro panel.

A glossary callout (`:::glossary` in `telar/widgets.py`) reaches this pass
as a slot, and `process_glossary_links()` resolves its entry the way it
resolves `[[entry]]`: the same case-insensitive lookup, and for an entry the
glossary lacks the same warning and the same error marker. A resolved one is
drawn from `_includes/widgets/glossary.html` with the entry's kind, which the
loaders keep beside each title in `GlossaryTerms.kinds`. The callout carries
the inline link's class and data attributes, so the browser treats it as one.

Term matching is case-insensitive: an author's `[[Term]]` resolves against
the stored key regardless of casing, and the rendered `data-term-id` is the
stored key.
