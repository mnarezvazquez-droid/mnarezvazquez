Glossary Entry Kinds

A glossary entry is of one kind: a key term, a primary source, a person or
entity, a place, or a kind the site defines for itself. The core kinds live
in `_data/glossary_kinds.yml`, which the layouts also read: they label the
glossary panel and group the glossary page by the kind id the build writes
into each entry's page as `glossary_kind`. This module is the build's side
of that file. It turns what an author wrote in the glossary sheet's `kind`
column, or in a markdown entry's `kind:` / `tipo:` front matter, into a kind
id.

A value is compared with case, accents, underscores, hyphens and repeated
spaces folded away, so `Fuente primaria`, `fuente_primaria` and
`FUENTE PRIMARIA` are one value. A blank value is the default kind. A value
that names no kind is the default kind too, and the build says so, naming
the entry and the values it accepts: a typo in a cell otherwise files a
source among the key terms and nothing tells the author why.

The core file is read from beside the scripts rather than from the working
directory. It is the framework's own, like the scripts, and a build run
from anywhere else reads the same list the layouts do.

A site's own kinds are read from `glossary: kinds:` in the site's
`_config.yml`. Each has an `id`, a `label` for the panel and a `heading` for
the glossary page, both written in the site's language, and optional
`values`; its id is always a value. A site kind without a label or a
heading, or whose id or values are already a value of a core kind or of an
earlier site kind, is left out with a warning naming it: accepting it would
take entries from the kind that already owns the value. The accepted ones
follow the core kinds, in the order the config gives them, and
`write_site_kinds()` hands them to the layouts in `_data/`, where Liquid can
read them; the config key `glossary` is shadowed there by the glossary
collection.
