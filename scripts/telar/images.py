Image Processing

This module deals with Telar's extended image syntax and image path
validation. Standard markdown already converts `![alt](path)` into an
`<img>` tag, but Telar adds two features on top: size modifiers
(`{sm}`, `{md}`, `{lg}`, `{full}`) and automatic captions from the
line below the image. Because the markdown library doesn't know about
these extensions, this module runs first — it intercepts the raw text,
replaces image lines with fully formed `<figure>` HTML, and passes the
result onward for normal markdown conversion.

The main function is `process_images()`, which scans text line by line
looking for image declarations in the form `![alt](path){size}`. The
optional `{size}` modifier maps to CSS classes (`img-sm`, `img-md`, etc.)
that control display width in the story panel. If the next line after an
image is non-empty plain text, it is treated as a caption and wrapped in
a `<figcaption>`. The optional "caption: " prefix is stripped if present.
Relative image paths are resolved to `<baseurl>/telar-content/objects/`,
the site's configured baseurl included. The HTML this module writes reaches
the browser unrewritten on a glossary page, in the glossary panel (which
fetches that page) and on a user page, so the path has to be one the
browser can fetch as written; a site served under a baseurl, as every GitHub
Pages project site is, otherwise asks the host root for the file.

A carousel image can live anywhere in the site. `locate_image()` decides
which file an `image:` value names: a path with a folder in it is read from
the site root, and a bare file name is looked for in `assets/images/` and
then `telar-content/objects/`. `validate_image_path()` and
`get_image_dimensions()` both go through it, so the file checked and
measured is the file the carousel publishes. Lookups allow for letter case
because Telar sites are developed on macOS (case-insensitive filesystem)
but often deployed on Linux (case-sensitive):
`resolve_path_case_insensitive()` tries the exact path, then the lowercase
file name, then the whole path lowercased, and the extension is also tried
in upper and lower case (`.jpg` against `.JPG`). External URLs (http/https)
bypass validation entirely.

`get_image_dimensions()` reads image width and height, used by the
carousel widget to calculate aspect ratios and choose an appropriate
size class. It supports both local files (via Pillow) and remote URLs
(fetched with urllib). Failures are silent — dimension detection is
a nice-to-have, not a build blocker.
