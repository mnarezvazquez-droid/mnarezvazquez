Story Encryption Module

This module provides client-side encryption for protected stories using
AES-GCM. Protected stories are encrypted at build time; the browser
decrypts them at runtime using the Web Crypto API.

The encryption uses:
- PBKDF2 with 210,000 iterations for key derivation
- AES-256-GCM for authenticated encryption
- Random salt (16 bytes) and IV (12 bytes) per story

The encrypted format stores salt and IV alongside the ciphertext so the
browser can derive the same key and decrypt the content.

Security model:
    This provides a deterrent against casual access (the step data is not
    readable in plain text from the page source), not confidentiality. On a
    public site, the source CSV remains in the published output and is
    publicly accessible. The salt, IV, and ciphertext are all embedded in
    the page HTML, making offline attacks feasible. For genuine
    confidentiality, the repository must be private.
