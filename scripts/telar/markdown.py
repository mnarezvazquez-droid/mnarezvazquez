Markdown File Processing

This module deals with loading and converting markdown content that
appears in story panels. Panel content can come from two sources: a
markdown file on disk (referenced by filename like `my-panel.md` in the
CSV), or inline text typed directly into the spreadsheet cell. Both
paths converge on the same processing pipeline: widgets are parsed first
(via the widgets module), then images are processed (via the images
module), and finally the standard markdown library converts whatever
remains to HTML.

`read_markdown_file()` handles file-based content. It resolves the file
path with case-insensitive fallback (using `resolve_path_case_insensitive`
from the images module), parses optional YAML frontmatter to extract a
title, and then runs the content through the widget/image/markdown
pipeline. Files are expected under `telar-content/texts/`.

`process_inline_content()` handles text written directly in spreadsheet
cells. It normalises line endings (spreadsheets may use `\\r\\n` or
`\\r`), checks for optional YAML frontmatter (only treated as frontmatter
if it contains a `title:` key, to avoid false matches with `---` used
as horizontal rules), and then runs the same pipeline.

`render_markdown()` is the conversion every whole body of author text goes
through -- panels, step answers, pages and glossary pages: it closes any
HTML container the text leaves open, then converts with
`telar.latex.convert_markdown`, whose extensions (`extra`, `nl2br`,
`smarty`) are the same for every conversion, so a single line break is a
line break and quotes and ellipses are typographic wherever an author
writes them.

Content trust model (raw-HTML pass-through is intentional)
----------------------------------------------------------
Markdown is converted without an HTML sanitiser, so raw HTML
embedded in author markdown/CSV content passes straight through to the
rendered page. This is by design: Telar is a minimal-computing static-site
framework whose content is authored by trusted contributors (the same
people who control the repo), and authors legitimately rely on raw HTML
for layout the markdown syntax cannot express. Adding a sanitiser
(bleach / nh3) would both strip that legitimate HTML and add a runtime
dependency that cuts against the project's no-dependency ethos.

This is a conscious threat-model decision: the trusted-author model.
It holds only while content authorship is trusted.
A multi-author deployment where untrusted users can write story content
(e.g. a future hosted Compositor) must NOT rely on this — it should layer
DOMPurify on the injected panel/glossary HTML in the JS runtime, where the
untrusted boundary actually is.

    """
    Split optional YAML frontmatter from content, returning (title, body).

    A leading `---` block counts as front matter only when it carries a
    `title:` key. `---` is also the markdown horizontal rule, and a rule at
    the top of a panel is an ordinary thing to write: without the
    condition, everything up to the author's next rule is read as metadata
    and discarded, silently, and the panel still renders — just shorter.

    `title` is the only key anything reads out of these blocks, so a block
    without one has nothing any caller would have used. Of the two ways to
    be wrong, this is the loud one: front matter mistaken for content puts
    visible YAML on the page, where its author can see it, while content
    mistaken for front matter simply disappears.

    A block that does parse as a YAML mapping and has no title is kept as
    content and warned about, so its author sees why their metadata appears
    on the page. Ordinary prose under a rule does not parse as a mapping and
    says nothing.

    A single prose line containing a colon does parse as a mapping, so it is
    warned about too. The warning is advisory, the text is kept either way,
    and the remedy it suggests — separate the block from the text below it —
    is good advice for a line that ambiguous.
