Bilingual Messages for the Telar Upgrade System

This module deals with every user-facing string the upgrade workflow
prints or writes, in both English and Spanish, so that `upgrade.py` and
the individual migrations never hardcode language-specific text. A site's
language comes from `telar_language` in `_config.yml`; the upgrade code
reads it once and then asks this module for each string by key.

`MESSAGES` is a two-level dictionary — `'en'` and `'es'`, each mapping a
stable key to its translated string. Keys are grouped by where they
surface: the upgrade console output, the fail-closed / resume flow, the
sections and category headings of the generated `UPGRADE_SUMMARY.md`, and
the common phrases migrations reuse. Some strings carry `{}` placeholders
filled in at call time (a version number, a file path, a count).

`get_message(lang, key, *args)` is the main entry point. It normalises an
unknown language code to English, looks the key up in the requested
language, falls back to the English string (and finally the raw key) when
a translation is missing, and applies `str.format()` only when arguments
are supplied — returning the unformatted string rather than raising if the
placeholders and arguments do not line up.

`get_file_count_suffix(lang, count)` is a small helper for the one place
grammatical number matters in the summary: it returns the singular or
plural of "file" in the active language so category headings read
naturally ("1 file" / "2 files", "1 archivo" / "2 archivos").
