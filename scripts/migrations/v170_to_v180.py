Migration from v1.7.0 to v1.8.0.

v1.8.0 is about what a site publishes and what an upgrade tells its owner.
Nine kinds of change reach an existing site, in this order.

1. Framework files (FRAMEWORK_FILES, installed atomically from the v1.8.0
   tag): every file a site owns that the release adds or changes. The
   object page is split into one bundle per media type, the story engine
   gains per-type plates, the glossary gains kinds and an index by kind,
   and the build scripts gain the shared markdown converter, the page and
   glossary generators split out of `generate_collections.py`, and the
   column-collision refusal. Bundles ship with the modules they are built
   from, and `generate_collections.py` with every `telar` module it imports,
   so the set installs whole or not at all. Fail closed: a FAILED record
   here returns before any later phase runs.

2. Removals (Phase 2): the single object-page bundle the three per-type
   bundles replace, with its map and entry module, and the stale root
   `migration.json`, the manifest of the 1.5.4 upgrade, which Jekyll
   publishes as a page.

3. Built-in pages (Phase 3): one default-content line in `index.md` and
   one in `pages/glossary.md`, where it is still the template's.

4. Colliding columns (Phase 4): the build now refuses a sheet with two
   columns claiming one name, and a failed regeneration leaves the site at
   1.7.0, so a benign collision is repaired here, before regeneration.

5. `_config.yml` (Phase 5): four `exclude` entries. `telar-content/texts/`
   keeps Jekyll from publishing the sources the build generates pages from;
   the other three keep Telar's own tests out of the site.

6. Page sources (Phase 6): a `layout` or `permalink` that repeats what the
   build supplies is removed. The build ignores both keys, so this is
   tidiness, not safety.

7. Glossary markdown (Phase 7): a `related_terms` written as one scalar
   becomes a list, which is what the glossary layout iterates.

8. Step answers (Phase 8): reported, not changed. Every answer the build
   will cut, or strip of content an answer cannot show, is named in the
   summary before the first build runs.

9. The stale engine (Phase 9): a launcher site's leftover
   `scripts/telar_upgrade.py` and its three helpers are removed.

Phases 3 to 8 are in `v180_sources.py` and `v180_sheets.py`; each is
idempotent, so a run that stops at regeneration and is repeated after the
author fixes the cause completes.

Not delivered:

  - `tests/`, `pytest.ini`, `vitest.config.js` — Telar's own test suite,
    listed in `scripts/dev-only-files.txt`. The command-line route leaves a
    site's copies alone; the Compositor's manifest deletes them.
  - `.github/workflows/*` — the upgrade's GITHUB_TOKEN carries no
    `workflows: write`. The three changed workflows are manual steps.
  - `scripts/telar_upgrade.py`, its three `telar_upgrade_*` helpers and
    `scripts/migrations/` — the engine ships only in the verified release
    tarball, which `scripts/upgrade.py` downloads.
  - `_config.yml`, `index.md`, `pages/glossary.md`, `.gitignore` — the
    site's own, edited in place where the release needs a line in them.
  - `.gitattributes` — the site's own once v1.6.0 created it. The release
    changes only which bundles GitHub collapses as generated; a site's file
    still naming `object-page.js` affects nothing.

The version stamp (telar.version -> 1.8.0) is not written here. The engine
applies it once after every migration step and the regeneration succeed.
