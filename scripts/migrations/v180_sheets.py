Spreadsheets Before the First 1.8.0 Build

This module deals with the two things `v170_to_v180` checks in a site's
spreadsheets before regeneration runs: columns that claim one name, which
the build now refuses, and step answers the build will cut or strip.

**Colliding columns** (`repair_colliding_columns`). A sheet headed both
`medium` and `object_type` has two columns the build reads as one field.
Up to 1.7.0 the last one won, silently; from 1.8.0 the conversion refuses
the sheet and exits non-zero, which the engine treats as a hard failure, so
the site would stay at 1.7.0. Where the collision is benign, one column
holding values and the others empty, this repairs it by deleting the empty
ones, and says which column now holds the values. The rule is shared with
the Compositor's import:

  - a column is empty if every data row holds nothing after trimming;
    comment rows and a bilingual second header row are not data, and a
    column whose header starts with `#` is never a candidate;
  - columns collide on the terms `_refuse_colliding_renames` uses: the
    mapped name, or the header lowercased and trimmed;
  - exactly one holds values: keep it, drop the others;
  - none holds values: keep the one spelled as the canonical name, else
    the first in file order;
  - more than one holds values: drop nothing, and report, since only the
    author can say which is meant.

A removal may not change the rows the build reads as data. The build drops
a row whose first cell starts with `#` as a comment, then drops the `#`
columns, then judges whether the first row left is a bilingual header row,
so removing a column, the first above all, can turn a step into a comment
or change which row counts as a header. Each removal is checked against
those rules, over the columns that survive it. An empty first column whose
removal would change the rows is kept, with `#` put before its header, so
the build ignores it after reading the comment rows; any other removal
that would change them is not made, and reported.

Each sheet is read with the scoping the build reads it with: the project
and story sheets with the whole alias map, the objects sheet with the map
scoped to the fields objects have, and the glossary with the whole map
plus the aliases only the glossary reads.

**Step answers** (`report_step_answers`). Nothing is written. The build
holds an answer to prose and to `ANSWER_WORD_LIMIT` words, and this counts
each answer with the build's own functions so the author learns where they
ran the upgrade, rather than on the published site, which answers will be
cut and which will lose widgets, media, footnotes or markup.

Both import the build's rules from `telar` lazily. The engine runs from the
release's tooling, whose `scripts/` holds the matching `telar` package, but
pandas is installed only after migrations run, so an import that fails is a
soft record saying the build will report the same thing.

    first record pandas does not skip, and `body` the records after it that

    its delimiter out of a record and leave every other byte as it was:
