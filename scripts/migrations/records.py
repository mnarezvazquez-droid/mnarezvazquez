"""
Change Records and Shared Rules for Telar Upgrades

The vocabulary a migration reports in, and the rules the chain applies to
it, none of which needs a migration instance: `ChangeStatus`, `ChangeRecord`
and `ChangeCategory` with the path-to-heading tables, `FetchOutcome` and
`FetchResult` for a fetch that produced nothing, the manual-step audiences,
the launcher marker, the state file's name, `coerce_change`,
`is_hard_failure`, `is_author_step` and `is_flagged`, and
`apply_config_version`, the one writer of the `telar.version` stamp.

`base.py` re-exports these names, so `migrations.base` is the one import
for a migration, the engine and the tests, and holds the migration base
class alone.

#   local         — everyone except Compositor users, because the Compositor
#                   does this itself. In practice the workflow-file recopies,
#                   which exist only because GitHub will not let an automated
#                   upgrade write to .github/workflows/ and the Compositor
#                   commits them directly.
#   google-sheets — only sites that pull their content from Google Sheets.
#                   The Compositor shows these when the site has Sheets
#                   enabled and hides them otherwise.
#   compositor    — only Compositor users. Accepted by the filter and
#                   rendered, but it hides nothing from anyone: every reader
#                   of that screen is a Compositor user by definition. It is
#                   documentation, and a step may be left `all` instead.
#
# Two axes, not one. `local` and `compositor` are about the upgrade route;
# `google-sheets` is about how the site gets its content. A step can only
# declare one, so pick the axis that decides whether the reader must act.

    a text edit rather than a YAML round-trip, so the rest of the file keeps
    its comments, ordering and spacing exactly.

    The two lines it rewrites are the exception, and they are rewritten
    whole: a trailing comment on `version` or `release_date` does not
    survive, and the value comes back double-quoted whatever quoting it had.

    Single source of truth for the version stamp — both BaseMigration (per
    migration) and upgrade.py (the final stamp in main()) call this, so the
    parsing rules cannot drift between copies.

    What the parsing guarantees:
      - Indent-agnostic: any indented line is treated as inside the `telar:`
        section; the section ends only at the next non-blank column-0 line, so
        a single-space indent does not truncate it.
      - Inserts a release_date line right after version if the section has a
        version but no release_date.
      - Writes both lines at the top of the section if it declares neither.
        A `telar:` section with no version reads as 0.2.0-beta upstream, so
        the site runs the whole chain; leaving the stamp unwritten sends it
        through the chain again on the next run. A section that does not
        exist is still left alone -- inventing it would guess at a file
        this writer cannot see the shape of.

    Args:
        content: Full text of _config.yml.
        new_version: New version string (e.g. "1.5.0").
        new_date: New release date (e.g. "2026-06-03").
