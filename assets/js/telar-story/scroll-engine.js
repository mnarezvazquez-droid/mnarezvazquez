/**
 * Telar Story – Scroll Engine
 *
 * This module replaces the old discrete scroll accumulator with a
 * continuous scroll model powered by Lenis. Instead of counting scroll
 * ticks and jumping between steps, the user scrolls fluidly through the
 * story and the system derives a floating-point position from the scroll
 * offset — for example, position 2.3 means step 2 with 30% progress
 * toward step 3.
 *
 * Lenis is an open-source MIT-licensed smooth scroll library maintained
 * by Studio Freight. It provides a virtual scroll model that normalises
 * browser differences in scroll physics, giving Telar a consistent,
 * contemplative feel across platforms. It is bundled into the single
 * telar-story.js file by esbuild — no CDN dependency, no external
 * requests — keeping Telar fully self-contained and aligned with its
 * minimal-computing, zero-dependency hosting philosophy.
 *
 * Magnetic waypoints — the lenis/snap proximity plugin provides snap
 * points at every integer boundary (each story step). Snapping only
 * fires when scroll velocity drops below a threshold, so the user can
 * power through multiple steps with a fast scroll without being caught
 * by each waypoint along the way.
 *
 * Per-frame wiring — every animation frame, the scroll callback computes
 * the current fractional position and drives two visual systems:
 * setCardProgress interpolates the next card's position proportionally,
 * and lerpIiifPosition interpolates the IIIF viewer's
 * x/y/zoom coordinates between same-object step pairs. Smoothness comes
 * from Lenis's animatedScroll value, not from OpenSeadragon animations.
 *
 * Button and keyboard navigation — advanceToStep() triggers a Lenis
 * scrollTo() animation rather than jumping directly, so all navigation
 * paths (scroll, keyboard, buttons) go through the same visual pipeline.
 * On iOS Safari, Lenis is not initialised because its momentum model
 * is unreliable on that platform; the code path falls through to
 * button-only navigation in main.js.
 *
 * @version v1.8.0
