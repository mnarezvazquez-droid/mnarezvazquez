/**
 * Telar Story — Media Plate
 *
 * What a plate holding a player has in common, whichever player it is.
 *
 * `Plate.load()` caches a promise and answers from it forever after. That is
 * right where the plate owns its player and wrong here: `video-card.js` and
 * `audio-card.js` each keep their own player pool, capped at three and evicted
 * from inside themselves, so a player can go without the plate being told. The
 * pool is the only thing that knows, and `_hasPlayer` is where each subclass asks it.
 *
 * The plate also leaves by snapping rather than transitioning. A cross-origin
 * iframe on mobile breaks the compositing a CSS transform transition needs, so
 * the transition is suppressed for the move and restored after it.
 *
 * @version v1.8.0
