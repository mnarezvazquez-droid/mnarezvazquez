/**
 * Telar Story — Base Plate
 *
 * One viewer for a scene. The instance is permanent; its player loads/unloads.
 *
 * Two axes:
 *   load / unload      — the player (libraries + file + GPU)
 *   center / sendBack  — the visual position
 *
 * A plate type says what its player is and how to build, frame and free it;
 * the card stack says when. Everything a type knows about itself lives in its
 * subclass, so adding one is writing a file rather than finding the places
 * that branch.
 *
 * A plate is stood down in one of two ways. `deactivate` stands it down
 * without moving it: forward, the plate the reader leaves stays exactly where
 * it is and is covered by the plate arriving over it. `sendBack` stands it down
 * and puts it back off screen below, and is defined in terms of `deactivate`.
 *
 * @version v1.8.0
