/**
 * Telar Story – IIIF Card Positioning and Lifecycle
 *
 * This module handles the positioning, activation, destruction, and
 * per-frame interpolation of IIIF viewer plates in the card-stack layout.
 * It does not create viewer plates or inject viewer instances — that work
 * lives in card-pool.js, which pre-creates all plate DOM elements at init
 * time and injects the IIIF wrapper on demand via its internal
 * _initOsdInPlate().
 *
 * The separation exists because the card-pool module owns the full card
 * lifecycle (creation, ordering, preloading), while this module provides
 * the OSD-specific operations that card-pool and scroll-engine call into:
 *
 *   Positioning — `snapIiifToPosition()` and `animateIiifToPosition()`
 *   convert normalised x/y/zoom coordinates from step data into the values
 *   OpenSeadragon expects, applying a shift to compensate for the text card
 *   overlay. The compensation reads the measured card overlay rect
 *   (state.cardOverlayRect) and derives the card placement geometry to
 *   determine the visible area. The focal point is shifted so it lands
 *   in the visible area, not behind the card. Zoom is rescaled in vertical
 *   layout to fit the authored footprint in the visible region.
 *
 *   Per-frame interpolation — `lerpIiifPosition()` is called every frame by
 *   the scroll engine's rAF loop. For step pairs that share the same object,
 *   it interpolates x/y evenly and zoom by equal ratios between the two steps
 *   based on scroll progress and applies the result via snapIiifToPosition
 *   (immediate=true).
 *   A pair either side of zoom 1 is blended between the two steps' resting
 *   placements instead, because an overview and a detail place different
 *   image points at the region centre.
 *   Smoothness comes from Lenis's animatedScroll, not from OSD animations.
 *   Different-object pairs are skipped — the viewer freezes at its last
 *   position while the new plate slides in on top.
 *
 *   Destruction — `destroyIiifCard()` calls the wrapper's destroy(), nulls
 *   the references and removes the plate element. The viewer uses the
 *   Canvas2D drawer, so there is no WebGL context to release first.
 *
 * @version v1.8.0

 *
 * Two constraints act on each axis, and they pull opposite ways.
 *
 *   Coverage. The focal must sit within the image's own edge distance of the region
 *   edge, or the image does not reach it and the page background shows beside it:
 *     focal ≤ region.x + eLeft        and    focal ≥ region.x + region.w − eRight
 *
 *   Circle. The focal must sit at least the circle's radius inside, or the framed
 *   detail straddles the region boundary and part of it goes under the text card:
 *     focal ≥ region.x + radius       and    focal ≤ region.x + region.w − radius
 *
 * Both hold together whenever the image is wide enough, which is the ordinary case.
 * Where they cannot both hold — a focal nearer an image edge than the radius —
 * coverage wins: the focal is held where the image still reaches the region edge,
 * and the circle is allowed to straddle it. A visible band of background beside the
 * image is the worse failure: a reader sees it at once, and does not see a framed
 * detail sitting nearer the region edge than intended.
 *
 * Where the image is shorter than the region on an axis, it cannot cover it, and the
 * two coverage bounds cross: between them lie the positions that keep the whole image
 * inside the region. The focal is held there, as near the ideal as that allows, so
 * the image never hangs past a region edge under the text card or off the window.
 * At the length where the image starts to cover the axis the crossed bounds meet
 * the covering ones at the same point, so the placement changes continuously as the
 * scale grows through it. An overview is centred and so already inside the region;
 * it is not moved. An image exactly as long as the region (zoom 1, on its limiting
 * axis) covers it, and is placed edge to edge.
 *
 * This returns the target focal position (not a pan delta) and reads no live
 * OSD state, so the apply path is independent of the transient (mid-animation) zoom.

 *       authored zoom: at 1 the whole object fits and is centred in the region,
 *       and below 1 the same object stands back from the frame by that fraction.
 *       Between 1 and 2, interpolate linearly from the whole-object fit at 1 to
 *       the detail scale at 2. This keeps scale continuous without changing
 *       either overview or zoom ≥ 2 framing.
 *     No OSD-zoom calibration (no `k`): fitBounds derives the zoom from the rect.
 *   - Focal: move the anchor to the uncovered-region centre, clamped to the
 *     keep-circle bound (_clampFocalPx) — keep scale, hold the anchor at least the
 *     circle's radius from every region edge. It does not rely on OSD's visibilityRatio.
 *     The anchor is the image centre at zoom ≤ 1 (an overview is centred whatever
 *     its x/y) and the authored focal point at every zoom above 1.
 *   - Apply (_applyPlacement): build the image-px rectangle that fills the viewer at
 *     scale s with the anchor at the clamped position, then vp.fitBounds(rect,
 *     immediate). The target is a rectangle, not a delta off the live zoom, so it
