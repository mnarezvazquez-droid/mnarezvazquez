/**
 * Telar Story – Card Stack
 *
 * This module owns three distinct lifecycles in the card-stack layout:
 *
 *   1. The permanent text cards (state.textCards) — step index → element,
 *      built once at init time. Every card element is created up front and
 *      persists in the DOM for the lifetime of the page; nothing is ever
 *      evicted. Visibility is controlled entirely by CSS transforms, so
 *      slide transitions animate correctly without the jank of DOM
 *      insertion and removal. What a card is for — its step, its object, its
 *      place in the scene — is written on the element, so there is one answer
 *      to each of those questions rather than a map and a record that can
 *      disagree.
 *
 *   2. The plates (state.viewerPlates) — scene index → Plate, one per scene,
 *      built once and permanent. A Plate is the type its scene's object
 *      asks for, and it owns everything that type knows about itself: what
 *      its player is, how to build it, how to frame it to a step, how to
 *      stand it down. This module says when; the plate says how. Adding an
 *      object type is writing a file in plates/, not finding the places
 *      that branch.
 *
 *   3. The viewers inside the image plates, which form the viewer pool: the
 *      number holding a live OpenSeadragon instance is capped at
 *      config.maxViewerCards, and when over the cap the plate farthest by
 *      scene distance from the current position is unloaded. The plate
 *      stays; only the viewer in it goes. The player types keep their own
 *      pools, inside their own modules, on their own caps.
 *
 * Scene maps — a story step references an object by ID, but the same
 * object can appear in multiple non-contiguous scenes (A → B → A). To
 * handle this, the module builds a set of maps at init: stepToScene,
 * sceneToObject, and sceneFirstStep. All plate lookups are keyed by scene
 * index, not by object ID, so each appearance of an object gets its own
 * plate element.
 *
 * Z-ranges — each scene occupies a z-range of 100 z-index values.
 * Scene 0 gets 100–199, scene 1 gets 200–299, and so on. The viewer
 * plate sits at the range base; text cards sit at base + 1 + their
 * position within the scene. This ensures that newer plates always stack
 * above all cards from the previous scene.
 *
 * Context-sensitive stacking — when the user navigates to a new step,
 * the module decides what to do based on whether the object changed.
 * If it did, both a new viewer plate and a new text card slide up. If
 * the object is the same, only the text card changes — the existing
 * viewer plate stays visible and the IIIF viewer adjusts its position
 * without reloading. A mode change (detail view to full-object view or
 * vice versa on the same object) is treated as an object change.
 *
 * Preloading — after each step change, the module looks ahead and
 * initialises IIIF viewers, video players, or audio players for upcoming
 * scenes. It counts by scene distance, not step offset, so a long
 * sequence of steps on the same object does not waste preload slots.
 * When the viewer pool exceeds its cap (default 8), the instance farthest
 * by scene distance from the current position is evicted. IIIF tiles for
 * scenes beyond the OSD preload range are also prefetched as image
 * link hints.
 *
 * Accessibility — every viewer plate receives an aria-label built from
 * a fallback chain: step-level alt text, then object-level alt text, then
 * the object title, then the object ID, and finally a type-aware generic
 * label ("Image viewer", "Video player", or "Audio player"). The label
 * is refreshed on every step change.
 *
 * Exported pure functions (computeZIndexPlan, getSceneIndex, computeCardTop,
 * getCardMessiness) are unit-tested. DOM-interacting functions are
 * acceptance-tested against the running site.
 *

 * the scrubbing frame, the snap that knows its landing before it gets there, the
 * scroll that stops of its own accord, the keyboard move that has a target. The
 * position is the scroll engine's — 0 is the intro, 1 is step 0 — and the cards
 * follow from it. Three cards are in play at any position: the step it rests
 * on, at `translateY(0)` with its messiness; the one card it is part way
 * through, the proportion of a viewport up from below; and the card above that,
 * a full viewport down, which is the card the position has just stopped moving
 * and which a crossing would otherwise leave a pixel or two short of home. On a
 * whole step that is the resting invariant, and on a position between steps it
 * is the same interpolation a scrubbing frame writes, so a scroll that stops short
 * leaves the cards agreeing with it.
 *
 * Below position 1 the same three are the intro's: no step underneath, the
 * story's first card sliding up over the intro, and the second card waiting a
 * viewport down. The first viewer plate travels with the first card.
 *
 * The plates get the same treatment, in `_settlePlates`: a position states
 * where every plate in play stands, not only the one the step it is leaving
 * happens to move.
 *
 * The transition is left alone, so when the reader is not scrubbing the write
 * is a slide from wherever the card is and under `is-scrubbing` it is a
 * position. That is what makes a settle safe to run from scrubbing and from the
 * animation both.
 *
 * A settle states where a thing belongs, and where it already says that it
 * says nothing: a transform written over a transition that is running towards
 * it restarts that transition from wherever it has reached, so a settle that
 * repeats itself leaves the last per cent of a move running for another full
 * duration after the move looked finished.
