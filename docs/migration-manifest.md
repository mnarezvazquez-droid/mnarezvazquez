# Migration Manifest Schema — v1

Reference for authors writing `migration.json` files for Telar framework releases. This file is intended for the framework repo (`docs/migration-manifest.md`) so release authors can reference it.

## Purpose

Each Telar framework release includes a `migration.json` file that declares user-content transformations the Telar Compositor applies during upgrades. The compositor already handles framework file replacement via tree-diff — the manifest handles everything else: config changes, CSV column additions, file cleanup, and manual steps.

## File Location

- Attach `migration.json` as a **release asset** on the GitHub Release.
- The compositor fetches it via the GitHub Releases API alongside the release body.

## Schema

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "from_version": "1.1.0",
  "to_version": "1.2.0",
  "description": "Human-readable summary of this migration",
  "release_date": "2026-09-09",
  "operations": [],
  "manual_steps": {}
}
```

### Top-Level Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `schema_version` | integer | Yes | Always `1` for this schema version |
| `from_version` | string | Yes | Version this migration upgrades FROM (without `v` prefix) |
| `to_version` | string | Yes | Version this migration upgrades TO (without `v` prefix) |
| `description` | string | Yes | One-line summary of what changed |
| `release_date` | string | No | The date of the release, `YYYY-MM-DD`, taken from its git tag: the same value the command-line upgrade stamps into `telar.release_date`. The compositor refuses a value that is not a real calendar date. Every manifest from 1.8.0 on carries it |
| `operations` | array | Yes | Ordered list of transform operations (can be empty) |
| `manual_steps` | object | Yes | Bilingual manual steps shown after upgrade |

### Version Strings

Use the version number **without** the `v` prefix and **without** `-beta` unless the version genuinely has a prerelease suffix:

- `"1.1.0"` (not `"v1.1.0"`)
- `"0.9.0-beta"` (prerelease suffix preserved)

## Operations

Operations run **sequentially** in array order. Each operation has a `type` field and type-specific parameters.

### config_add_field

Add a new key to `_config.yml`.

```json
{
  "type": "config_add_field",
  "key": "collection_mode",
  "value": "false",
  "after_key": "telar_language",
  "comment": "Set to true for collection-first homepage",
  "skip_if_exists": true
}
```

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `key` | string | Yes | The config key to add |
| `value` | string | Yes | The default value |
| `after_key` | string | Yes | Insert after this existing key |
| `comment` | string | No | Appended as `# comment` after the value |
| `skip_if_exists` | boolean | No | Default `true` — no-op if key already present |

### config_update_value

Change an existing config value (only if it still has the old default).

```json
{
  "type": "config_update_value",
  "key": "max_viewer_cards",
  "old_value": "10",
  "new_value": "8"
}
```

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `key` | string | Yes | The config key to update |
| `old_value` | string | Yes | Only apply if current value matches this |
| `new_value` | string | Yes | The new value |

### config_rename_field

Rename a config key, preserving its value.

```json
{
  "type": "config_rename_field",
  "old_key": "testing",
  "new_key": "development-features"
}
```

### csv_add_column

Add a column to CSV files. Column names are bilingual — the compositor resolves using `telar_language` from the site's `_config.yml`.

```json
{
  "type": "csv_add_column",
  "file_glob": "**/project.csv",
  "column": { "en": "show_sections", "es": "mostrar_secciones" },
  "default": "",
  "after": { "en": "answer", "es": "respuesta" }
}
```

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `file_glob` | string | Yes | Glob pattern to find the CSV |
| `column` | `{ en, es }` | Yes | Bilingual column name |
| `default` | string | Yes | Value for existing rows (use `""` for blank) |
| `after` | `{ en, es }` | Yes | Bilingual name of column to insert after |

### csv_rename_column

Rename a CSV column header.

```json
{
  "type": "csv_rename_column",
  "file_glob": "**/objects.csv",
  "old_name": { "en": "iiif_manifest", "es": "iiif_manifest" },
  "new_name": { "en": "source_url", "es": "url_fuente" }
}
```

### file_delete

Delete files from the repository.

```json
{
  "type": "file_delete",
  "paths": ["assets/js/scrollama.min.js", "assets/js/openseadragon.min.js"]
}
```

### gitignore_add

Add entries to `.gitignore`.

```json
{
  "type": "gitignore_add",
  "patterns": ["_data/collections/", "_site/"],
  "section_comment": "Generated files"
}
```

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `patterns` | string[] | Yes | Gitignore patterns to add |
| `section_comment` | string | No | `# comment` header above the patterns |

Patterns are only added if not already present.

### regex_replace

Find-and-replace across files matching a glob.

```json
{
  "type": "regex_replace",
  "file_glob": "**/*.md",
  "search": "components/images/(objects|additional)/",
  "replace": "components/images/"
}
```

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `file_glob` | string | Yes | Files to process |
| `search` | string | Yes | JavaScript-flavoured regex pattern |
| `replace` | string | Yes | Replacement string (supports `$1`, `$2` groups) |

### yaml_list_add

Add values to a list in a YAML file, editing the text in place.

```json
{
  "type": "yaml_list_add",
  "file": "_config.yml",
  "key": "exclude",
  "values": ["telar-content/texts/", "tests/", "pytest.ini", "vitest.config.js"]
}
```

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `file` | string | Yes | The YAML file to edit |
| `key` | string | Yes | The top-level key whose list gains the values |
| `values` | string[] | Yes | Values to add, in order |

What happens depends on how the key is written:

- **A block list** (`exclude:` followed by `- item` lines) gets the missing values appended in place, at the list's own indentation.
- **A flow list** (`exclude: [a, b]`) gets them inserted inside the brackets. When the last item's line ends in a comment, they go on a line of their own before a `]` that has its own line, and the last item gains a comma before its comment; a comment inside the brackets never counts as the closing `]`.
- **A missing key** is added as a block list holding the values.
- **A scalar** (`exclude: vendor`) is rewritten as a block list with that value first, followed by the missing values. A value written on the key line keeps its text, quotes included, and a trailing comment stays on the key line; a string continued onto further lines is written double-quoted in their place (a comment line under it stays in the file), and a value on further lines that is not a string fails. A scalar equal to one of the values counts as present, and a scalar is rewritten even when it already covers every value, since Jekyll refuses an `exclude:` that is not a list.
- **A map** under the key is left alone, and the operation fails: the upgrade stops before committing and names the values to add.

A value already in the list is skipped. Present means the same string after YAML parsing, with one trailing slash dropped from both sides and nothing else normalised: `tests/`, `"tests/"` and `tests` are the same value, while `"tests/ "` (a trailing space inside the quotes), `tests//` and `Tests/` are not.

Four edge cases, handled the same way by the command-line upgrade:

- A bare `exclude:` with no value parses as null. It counts as missing, and is filled as a block list. A null written out (`~`, `null`, `Null`, `NULL`) is filled the same way: the token is dropped, a trailing comment stays on the key line, and the values go under it. A tagged `!!null` fails.
- A map under the key fails the operation, as above.
- The key is the top-level one wherever Jekyll's YAML reader finds it: after a byte-order mark or a `---` line, and at the mapping's own indentation when the whole mapping is indented, written plain or quoted (`exclude`, `"exclude"`, `'exclude'`), with or without spaces before the colon. The key line keeps the byte-order mark, the indentation and the key as written, and values under a key with no items yet go two spaces past it. A key of the same name nested under another is not it. Only the first document in the file is read and edited, as Jekyll reads only that one. A missing key is added at the end of that document, before a `...` or `---` line that ends it, at the indentation of the other top-level keys, with its values two spaces past it.
- A file that does not parse as YAML stops the upgrade before anything is committed.

The runner edits the text in place and never re-serialises the YAML, so every comment, key order and blank line in the file survives.

Use this rather than `regex_replace` for a list. A `regex_replace` is applied everywhere it matches with no guard, so an unbounded pattern inserts again on every run, or matches an entry outside the list.

### create_directory

Create a directory (and any missing parents).

```json
{
  "type": "create_directory",
  "path": "components/texts/pages"
}
```

## Manual Steps

Bilingual manual steps shown after upgrade. These are informational — they don't block the upgrade.

```json
{
  "manual_steps": {
    "en": [
      {
        "description": "Markdown text describing features and any manual actions",
        "audience": "all",
        "kind": "note",
        "doc_url": "https://telar.org/docs"
      }
    ],
    "es": [
      {
        "description": "Texto en markdown describiendo las novedades",
        "audience": "all",
        "kind": "note",
        "doc_url": "https://telar.org/guia"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Both `en` and `es` arrays are required, and the two must tag the same steps the same way — a step hidden in one language and shown in the other would make the site's language decide whether its owner is told to edit a workflow file. Each entry has:

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `description` | string | Yes | Markdown text (rendered in the compositor post-upgrade UI) |
| `audience` | string | Yes | Who still has to perform the step: `all` or `local` |
| `kind` | string | Yes | What the step asks of its reader: `action`, `optional` or `note` |
| `doc_url` | string | No | Link to documentation |

### `audience`

The set belongs to the Compositor, not to the framework: its post-upgrade screen filters on this field, so a value the filter does not recognise is a value that does nothing.

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `all` | Everyone upgrading, whatever route they took. |
| `local` | Everyone except Compositor users, because the Compositor performs the step itself. In practice the workflow-file recopies, which exist only because GitHub will not let an automated upgrade write to `.github/workflows/` and the Compositor commits them directly. |
| `google-sheets` | Only sites that pull their content from Google Sheets. Shown when the site has Sheets enabled and hidden otherwise. |
| `compositor` | Only Compositor users. Accepted and rendered, but it hides the step from nobody — every reader of that screen is a Compositor user. It is documentation, and such a step may be left `all` instead. |

The field is **required on every step**. A step that omits it is shown to everyone, which is the behaviour the field exists to prevent, so a missing value has to be an error rather than a default. A manifest published before this schema carries none at all, and the filter correctly shows those.

**Two axes, not one.** `local` and `compositor` are about the upgrade route; `google-sheets` is about how the site gets its content. A step declares one value, so pick the axis that decides whether the reader has to act.

It is not "who is this step about". A step whose prose already says "if you use GitHub Pages" is still `all`: every reader sees it and the prose sorts them out. Tagging by subject rather than by who must act would start hiding steps from the people who have to perform them.

### `kind`

The Compositor's post-upgrade screen groups steps by this field: actions as a numbered list, optional steps below them, and notes folded away under "What changed in this upgrade". When no action or optional step is left, it says that no manual steps are required.

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `action` | Something the upgrade left undone that the reader may need to do. A step that applies only in some cases ("If you customized the language packs, re-apply your changes") is still an action, because the reader is the one who can tell whether it applies. |
| `optional` | An action that need not be done. |
| `note` | What changed, including how to use it. |

The field is **required on every step**, on the same terms as `audience`. A step without it, or with a value the Compositor does not know, is shown under a heading of its own, and while one is shown the screen cannot tell its reader that nothing is left to do. The Compositor classifies the steps of releases published before this field in a table of its own; a manifest's own `kind` always takes precedence over that table.

`kind` and `audience` are independent. A workflow-file recopy is `local` and an `action`: the Compositor hides it, and a reader upgrading any other way has to do it.

## Validation Rules

The compositor validates manifests before applying. A manifest must:

1. Have `schema_version: 1`
2. Have `from_version` matching the site's current version
3. Have all required fields per operation type
4. Have bilingual variants (`en` + `es`) for all bilingual fields
5. Use only recognised operation types

If validation fails, the compositor shows an error and does not proceed.

## Producing a Manifest

When releasing a new Telar version:

1. Write the Python migration script as usual (`scripts/migrations/vXXX_to_vYYY.py`)
2. Write `migration.json` following this schema — it declares the same user-content transforms
3. The Python script is for CLI/Actions upgrades; the JSON is for compositor upgrades
4. Attach `migration.json` as a release asset when creating the GitHub Release
5. If the release has no user-content transforms (framework files only), the manifest still exists with an empty `operations` array — the manual steps are always useful
